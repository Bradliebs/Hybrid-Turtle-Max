# Repo Cleanup — 9 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — remove only disposable scratch/debug artifacts and backups that are not referenced by runtime code
**Goal:** Reduce root clutter by deleting dev-only diagnostics, captured output files, and an obsolete backup markdown file that the repo already treats as disposable.

## Plan

- [x] Remove root debug/temp scripts and captured output files already excluded by packaging
- [x] Remove the obsolete markdown backup snapshot from the root
- [x] Record the cleanup result here

## Review

- Removed root-only scratch/debug scripts: `_check.js`, `_db_check.mjs`, `_db_inspect*.js`, `_verify*.js`.
- Removed captured output artifacts: `test_output.txt`, `test_output_stop.txt`, `tsc_output.txt`.
- Removed obsolete root backup snapshot: `SYSTEM-BREAKDOWN.md.bak-20260307`.
- Kept functional `.txt` files under `Planning/` and `services/model-service/requirements.txt` because they are real inputs/runtime assets, not scratch artifacts.

## Verification

- Re-ran file search after deletion: root scratch/debug files are gone.
- Remaining `.txt` files are limited to legitimate planning inputs and Python requirements.

# Phase 13 Tests, Hardening, and Deployment — 9 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — deployment packaging, CI, verification, and test coverage only; no changes to sacred stop, sizing, or risk-gate logic
**Goal:** Complete Phase 13 only by tightening the test suite around the build-order requirements, adding CI and deployment assets, documenting stable local/cloud runtime paths, and verifying the documented commands work.

## Plan

- [x] Add the missing Phase 13 test coverage slices called out by the spec: market-data normalization, plan state transitions, and broker adapter contract tests
- [x] Add Phase 13 runtime packaging: Dockerfile, Docker Compose, optional model-service scaffold, and a phase verifier script
- [x] Add CI automation for core tests and build validation, fixing any surfaced hardening issues that directly block reliable runtime
- [x] Update README and environment templates with local/cloud deployment commands and record verification/results here

## Review

- Added Phase 13 test coverage for three explicit build-order gaps: Yahoo market-data normalization, planned-trade state transitions, and broker adapter contract behaviour against the mock fixture.
- Extended Vitest to include `packages/**/*.test.ts`, added a dedicated `verify:phase13` script, and added a GitHub Actions workflow that runs asset verification, the unit suite, and a production build.
- Added deployment assets for the current stable runtime: root `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml`, an optional FastAPI model-service scaffold, and deployment documentation in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Updated `.env.example` and `README.md` with Phase 13 deployment and verification commands.
- While validating the production build, fixed existing strict type issues across `packages/broker`, `packages/data`, `packages/stops`, `packages/workflow`, `prisma.config.ts`, `src/app/api/scan/route.ts`, `src/components/settings/SafetyControlsPanel.tsx`, and `src/lib/telegram.ts` so the app now builds successfully.

## Verification

- `npm run verify:phase13` → passed
- `npm run test:unit` → passed (`39` files, `624` tests)
- `npm run build` → passed
- Build still reports existing React hook lint warnings, but they are non-blocking and do not fail the production build

# Phase 12 ML Integration Layer — 9 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — advisory ranking overlay only; must not bypass or alter sacred execution, stop, sizing, or risk-gate logic
**Goal:** Complete Phase 12 only by adding an optional TypeScript model-service boundary, wiring model-assisted ranking into the scan display layer, exposing model APIs/settings, and verifying that the core workflow remains intact when the model layer is toggled on or off.

## Plan

- [x] Add a modular model package with `predictCandidateScore()`, `predictBreakoutProbability()`, and `predictRegime()` plus version metadata
- [x] Add a persisted model-layer toggle in settings and expose model service API routes
- [x] Wire the scan flow and candidate UI to show base score, model score, blended score, and confidence/uncertainty without changing hard trading logic
- [x] Add `verify:phase12`, apply the additive schema change safely, and record verification/results here

## Review

- Added a new `packages/model` TypeScript package that exposes the Phase 12 model boundary: `predictCandidateScore()`, `predictBreakoutProbability()`, `predictRegime()`, model version metadata, and a scan-candidate overlay helper.
- Added a persisted `modelLayerEnabled` user setting, exposed it through `/api/settings`, and wired it into the existing Settings prediction panel so the model layer can be turned on and off without affecting hard trading logic.
- Added Phase 12 model APIs: `POST /api/models/predict-candidates`, `POST /api/models/predict-risk`, and `GET /api/models/versions`.
- Wired the existing `/api/scan` flow to apply the model overlay as a post-processing ranking layer only. Base `rankScore` remains intact; the UI now shows base score, model score, blended score, confidence, and uncertainty on the candidate table when the setting is enabled.
- Corrected the scan route's package import path while integrating the model overlay so the route can compile in the app bundle.

## Verification

- `npx prisma db execute --file prisma/migrations/20260309133000_phase12_model_layer_toggle/migration.sql --schema prisma/schema.prisma` → passed
- `npm run db:generate` → passed
- `npm run verify:phase12` → passed
- `npm run build` → Phase 12 and the touched scan/settings/model files compile, but the full build is still blocked by an unrelated existing Prisma JSON typing issue in `packages/broker/src/repository.ts`

# Phase 11 Backtesting and Replay — 9 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — read-only historical validation over existing snapshot history; reuses scoring and stop simulation logic without changing live execution, sizing, or sacred stop/risk files
**Goal:** Complete Phase 11 only by adding a shared backtest runner, persisted backtest-run records, Phase 11 API routes, a date-range/replay UI, and a verifier aligned to the build-order contract.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the current `/backtest` flow and extract reusable replay logic into a shared package module
- [x] Add the Phase 11 persistence model and migrate Prisma for stored backtest runs
- [x] Build Phase 11 APIs for run + fetch, then wire the `/backtest` page to date-range and replay-date controls
- [x] Add `verify:phase11`, run verification, and record the result here

## Review

- Added a dedicated `packages/backtest` module that reuses the live dual-score stack and monotonic stop simulation over historical snapshot history, then turns the resulting trades into a fixed-risk equity and drawdown curve.
- Added a persisted `BacktestRun` model plus Phase 11 API routes: `POST /api/backtests/run` stores a run and `GET /api/backtests/:id` fetches the stored result for the UI.
- Rebuilt `/backtest` into a date-range backtesting page with replay-date mode, equity/drawdown charts, summary metrics, and a searchable trade log.
- Added `verify:phase11` and validated both the standard date-range flow and replay-date flow through the shared runner and stored-run fetch path.
- `prisma migrate dev --name phase11_backtest_runs` was blocked by pre-existing drift in the local SQLite database, so the Phase 11 migration was recorded in `prisma/migrations/20260309120000_phase11_backtest_runs/migration.sql` and applied non-destructively with `prisma db execute` instead of resetting local data.

## Verification

- `npm run db:generate` → passed
- `npm run verify:phase11` → passed

---

# Phase 10 Alerts and Safe Failure Controls — 9 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** YES — kill switches can block live submissions and scans, but will not modify sacred stop, sizing, or risk-gate logic
**Goal:** Complete Phase 10 only by adding a safety-alert projection, in-app alert surfaces, persisted kill-switch controls, and enforcement at the actual scan/submission entry points.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the current notification, settings, and execution entry points against the Phase 10 contract
- [x] Add shared safety services for active alerts and persisted kill-switch settings
- [x] Build an alerts page/panel and add safety toggles to settings
- [x] Enforce kill switches in scan and submission paths, then verify Phase 10 end to end

## Review

- Added persisted Phase 10 kill switches in the workflow package and exposed them through a dedicated settings API and settings panel.
- Added a shared safety-alert projection that surfaces stale market data, broker sync failure, unprotected positions, stop mismatches, failed orders, excessive drawdown, and risk-limit breaches.
- Added an alerts page and a dashboard safety-alerts panel so dangerous states are visible without digging through logs.
- Enforced the new kill switches at the real scan and submission entry points: manual execution, workflow submission, and scan execution.
- Updated notification delivery so Telegram can use default-user DB credentials as a fallback when env vars are not set, and aligned the notification centre with the new Phase 10 alert types.

## Verification

- `npm run verify:phase10` → passed
- `npm run verify:phase9` → passed regression check after dashboard/system navigation changes

---

# Phase 9 Portfolio Dashboard and History — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — review/dashboard surfaces only; reads existing portfolio, stop, order, plan, and job state without changing sacred execution logic
**Goal:** Complete Phase 9 only by adding an integrated evening-review projection, filling the missing review pages, wiring dashboard summary visibility, and verifying that nightly review can be completed entirely inside the app.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the current dashboard and page coverage against the Phase 9 contract
- [x] Add a shared evening-review data projection for dashboard, planned trades, stops, orders, and jobs/logs
- [x] Build the missing Phase 9 pages and wire navigation
- [x] Add the Phase 9 dashboard summary block and verify the review flow end to end

## Review

- Added a shared Phase 9 evening-review projection in `packages/portfolio` so the dashboard widget, review pages, and verifier all read the same portfolio, stop, order, plan, and job state.
- Added the missing required review pages: planned trades, stops, orders, and jobs/logs.
- Added a dashboard summary block with the required nightly-review metrics: equity, cash, open positions, open risk, protected vs unprotected positions, candidate count, approved plan count, latest broker sync, and latest data freshness.
- Wired the new review pages into the main navigation without changing any sacred risk, sizing, or stop ladder logic.
- Added `verify:phase9` to validate the review projection and required page coverage.

## Verification

- `npm run verify:phase9` → passed
- `npm run verify:phase8` → passed regression check for the reused stop dashboard projection

---

# Phase 8 Protective Stop Management — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** YES — protective stop workflow touches position protection state, but does not modify sacred stop ladder logic in the main app
**Goal:** Implement a dedicated Phase 8 stop manager package, wire stop verification into broker sync and evening reconciliation, add a stop dashboard projection, and verify that protected vs unprotected positions are clearly surfaced.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the current stop-related implementation against the Phase 8 contract
- [x] Add a modular stop manager package and dashboard projection
- [x] Wire the stop workflow into broker sync and evening reconciliation
- [x] Add Phase 8 scripts and verification

## Review

- Added a dedicated `packages/stops` module with a production-oriented stop workflow, persistence helpers, and dashboard projection.
- Wired broker sync to trigger the protective-stop workflow immediately after syncing positions and orders, so newly filled positions get stop handling without waiting for a separate manual step.
- Replaced the workflow package's placeholder missing-stop logic with the new Phase 8 stop manager, keeping evening reconciliation aligned with the build-order contract.
- Added a CLI stop dashboard and a dedicated `verify:phase8` acceptance script.
- Kept the current Prisma schema intact and mapped the richer persisted stop states into the Phase 8 dashboard categories (`PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `MISSING`, `MISMATCHED`, `FAILED`, `CLOSED`) instead of forcing a broad schema migration.

## Verification

- `npm run verify:phase8` → passed
- `npm run stops:view` → showed current protected vs unprotected positions from the mock broker dataset
- `npm run verify:phase3` → passed after broker-sync integration changes
- `npm run verify:phase4` → passed after reconciliation/verify-stops integration changes

---

# Phase 2 Execution Audit — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — market-data ingestion only; no stop, sizing, or risk-gate changes
**Goal:** Re-validate the existing Phase 2 Yahoo Finance ingestion against the build spec, correct any production-readiness gaps, and verify the phase end to end without touching later phases.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the current Phase 2 implementation against BUILD-ORDER.md and VSCode-Agent-Trading-App-Spec.md
- [x] Fix any Phase 2-only contract or production-readiness gaps
- [x] Run the Phase 2 verifier and record the result

## Review

- Confirmed the existing `packages/data` implementation already matched the Phase 2 contract: Yahoo historical-bar fetch, normalization, idempotent upsert, stale-symbol marking, per-run job history, and nightly scheduler wiring were present.
- Fixed retry accounting in `packages/data/src/service.ts` so each symbol refresh records the actual retry count instead of silently reporting zero on successful retries.
- Added the missing direct runtime dependencies `dotenv` and `p-limit` to `package.json`, which were required by the existing Phase 2 scripts and service but were not declared.
- Re-aligned Prisma to the version compatible with the generated client already present in the workspace so verification could run successfully on the current machine.

## Verification

- `npm run verify:phase2` → passed
- First run: 30 requested, 30 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 stale
- Second run: no duplicate rows introduced; `dailyBar` count remained 7500
- Invalid symbol test: `INVALID_PHASE2` correctly marked stale with reason `No data found, symbol may be delisted`

---

# Phase 7 Order Planning and Submission — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** YES — submits orders through the broker adapter; creates BrokerOrder records linked to PlannedTrades
**Goal:** Implement planned trade state machine (DRAFT→APPROVED→READY→SUBMITTED→FILLED/CANCELLED/REJECTED), order submission via broker adapter, and audit trail for every execution action.

## Plan

- [x] Add REJECTED to PlannedTradeStatus enum
- [x] Create `packages/workflow/src/execution.ts` with state transitions and order submission
- [x] Create `scripts/verify-phase7.ts` acceptance verifier
- [x] Wire `verify:phase7` in package.json
- [x] Regenerate Prisma client and sync local DB
- [x] Run `verify:phase7` and record the result

## Review

- Added `REJECTED` to the `PlannedTradeStatus` enum in Prisma schema to complete the Phase 7 state machine.
- Created `packages/workflow/src/execution.ts` with:
  - `transitionPlannedTrade()` — validates state transitions against a whitelist of valid moves
  - `approvePlannedTrade()` — DRAFT → APPROVED
  - `markTradeReady()` — APPROVED → READY
  - `submitPlannedTrade()` — READY → SUBMITTED, calls `adapter.placeOrder()`, creates linked BrokerOrder, logs audit event
  - `cancelPlannedTrade()` — DRAFT/APPROVED/READY → CANCELLED
  - `getPlannedTradesForSession()` — session-based trade query with linked broker orders
  - `getTradeAuditTrail()` — audit event query for a specific planned trade
- Every state transition and order submission creates an AuditEvent via `createAuditEvent()`.
- On submission failure, the trade is automatically moved to REJECTED with an error audit event.
- Terminal states (FILLED, CANCELLED, REJECTED) block all further transitions.
- The mock broker adapter returns a dry-run order result; the execution service is broker-agnostic via the adapter pattern.

## Verification

- `npx prisma generate` → client regenerated with REJECTED enum
- `npm run db:verify` → all 805 columns present
- `npm run verify:phase7` → passed
- `npm run verify:phase6` → still passes (regression check)

## Notes

- The verifier creates test trades, exercises the full state machine, verifies audit events, and cleans up after itself.
- Order submission confirmed: BrokerOrder linked to PlannedTrade via `plannedTradeId` FK, with `brokerOrderId` from the adapter.
- The existing broker sync (`packages/broker/src/sync.ts`) already handles filled order → PlannedTrade linking via `findMatchingPlannedTrade()`, completing the Phase 7 requirement that "filled orders link back to planned trades."

# Phase 6 Risk Engine and Position Sizing — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** YES (advisory layer only) — creates a risk validation package that gates planned trade creation; does NOT modify sacred files (risk-gates.ts, position-sizer.ts, stop-manager.ts)
**Goal:** Build `packages/risk` with account risk state, per-trade sizing, gate validation, stop distance checks, and risk rationale on planned trades. Wire into the evening workflow plan builder so planned trades cannot be marked ready if they breach risk rules.

## Plan

- [x] Create `packages/risk/src/types.ts` with risk assessment types
- [x] Create `packages/risk/src/account-state.ts` for unified risk state query
- [x] Create `packages/risk/src/sizing.ts` for per-trade share sizing with risk budget
- [x] Create `packages/risk/src/validation.ts` for risk gate checks on candidates
- [x] Create `packages/risk/src/index.ts` barrel export
- [x] Add risk rationale fields to PlannedTrade schema
- [x] Wire plan builder to use risk validation before creating trades
- [x] Create `scripts/verify-phase6.ts` acceptance verifier
- [x] Wire package.json scripts and verify

## Review

- Created `packages/risk/` with 5 source files implementing the Phase 6 risk engine:
  - `types.ts` — AccountRiskState, TradeSizingResult, RiskViolation, TradeRiskAssessment
  - `account-state.ts` — queries unified account risk state from latest portfolio snapshot and open positions
  - `sizing.ts` — per-trade share sizing with floor-down logic (never rounds up, matches sacred position-sizer rule)
  - `validation.ts` — 6 risk gates: MIN_SHARES, MAX_OPEN_RISK (10%), MAX_POSITIONS (4), STOP_DISTANCE (10%), STOP_BELOW_ENTRY, CONCENTRATION (30%) + 2 soft warnings (MISSING_STOPS, LOW_CASH)
  - `index.ts` — barrel export for the public API
- Added 4 risk fields to `PlannedTrade` in Prisma schema: `riskPerTrade`, `riskApproved`, `riskRationale`, `riskViolationsJson`
- Rewired `packages/workflow/src/plan.ts` to use `assessTradeRisk()` from the risk package — trades are now gated through risk validation before creation
- Updated `packages/workflow/src/repository.ts` to accept and persist risk rationale fields on planned trades
- Created `scripts/verify-phase6.ts` acceptance verifier covering all Phase 6 criteria
- No sacred files modified (risk-gates.ts, position-sizer.ts, stop-manager.ts untouched)

## Verification

- `npx prisma generate` → client regenerated with PlannedTrade risk fields
- `npm run db:verify` → local SQLite schema synced (4 new columns added to PlannedTrade)
- `npm run verify:phase6` → passed
- `npm run verify:phase5` → still passes (regression check)

## Notes

- The current mock portfolio has 55% open risk and 3 missing stops, so all candidate trades are correctly blocked by the risk engine. This is the expected behavior — planned trades cannot be created when risk limits are breached.
- The risk package replicates the floor-down sizing rule from the sacred position-sizer without importing from it, to keep the modular package layer decoupled from the main app's sacred files.
- Risk gate thresholds (10% max open risk, 4 max positions, 30% max concentration, 10% max stop distance) match the SMALL_ACCOUNT profile documented in CLAUDE.md.

---

# Phase 5 Signals and Ranking Engine — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — read-only scan and ranking modules; no stop ladder, risk gates, or position sizing changes
**Goal:** Verify that Phase 5 signals and ranking engine passes all acceptance criteria against the current HybridTurtle workspace.

## Plan

- [x] Read Phase 5 requirements from BUILD-ORDER.md
- [x] Audit existing signals package code against the Phase 5 contract
- [x] Identify any missing modules, scripts, or schema alignment
- [x] Run `verify:phase5` and record the result

## Review

- All Phase 5 modules already existed and met the BUILD-ORDER contract:
  - `packages/signals/src/trend.ts` — trend analysis (SMA20, SMA55, EMA21, slope, trend score)
  - `packages/signals/src/breakout.ts` — breakout analysis with 7 setup status buckets matching the spec
  - `packages/signals/src/ranking.ts` — risk filter (ATR-based initial stop, stop distance validation) + composite ranking
  - `packages/signals/src/candidates.ts` — full scan orchestration, persistence, and sortable candidate list view
  - `packages/signals/src/math.ts` — SMA, EMA, slope, highest, ATR, rounding utilities
  - `packages/signals/src/types.ts` — full type definitions for all signal outputs
- All required Phase 5 scripts were already wired: `signals:run`, `signals:view`, `verify:phase5`.
- The Prisma schema already contains `SignalRun` and `SignalCandidate` models with all required fields.
- No code changes or schema changes were needed — the compatibility fixes applied during Phase 4 (toNumeric helper, plain-number persistence, Json-typed reasons/warnings) had already made the signals package fully functional.

## Verification

- `npm run verify:phase5` → passed
- 30 symbols scanned, 30 candidates persisted with status SUCCEEDED
- All required output fields present: symbol, currentPrice, triggerPrice, initialStop, stopDistancePercent, riskPerShare, setupStatus, rankScore, reasons, warnings
- Rank-sorted and symbol-sorted candidate list views both validated correctly
- Top candidates: CVX (102.98 rank, READY_ON_TRIGGER), NFLX (87.91, EARLY_BIRD), ADBE (74.30, READY_ON_TRIGGER)

## Notes

- No new files created for Phase 5 — the signals package was already complete from earlier build-order work and the Phase 4 compatibility fixes.
- The verifier exercises the full signal scan pipeline: instrument loading → bar conversion → trend/breakout/risk analysis → ranking → persistence → sortable list view retrieval.

---

# Phase 4 Evening Workflow — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — workflow orchestration and dashboard-card persistence only; no stop ladder, risk gates, or sizing rules changed
**Goal:** Complete and verify Phase 4 only by restoring the evening-workflow persistence models, wiring the workflow scripts, and validating the full Tonight's Workflow orchestration path.

## Plan

- [x] Recheck the Phase 4 workflow contract against the current workflow package and verifier
- [x] Restore the evening-workflow Prisma models required by the current workflow runtime
- [x] Wire the missing Phase 4 workflow scripts in `package.json`
- [x] Regenerate Prisma client and sync the local SQLite schema
- [x] Run `verify:phase4` and record the result

## Review

- Confirmed the existing Phase 4 workflow implementation was already present in `packages/workflow`, including the 7-step orchestration, persisted dashboard card projection, and the verifier contract in `scripts/verify-phase4.ts`.
- Restored the Prisma persistence models that the runtime expected for workflow execution history: `EveningWorkflowRun` and `EveningWorkflowStepRun`.
- Wired the missing package scripts for `workflow:run`, `workflow:card`, and `verify:phase4` so the workflow and verifier can be executed directly from the repo root.
- Fixed a runtime compatibility gap in `packages/signals/src/candidates.ts` by normalizing persisted numeric values that may arrive either as plain numbers or Decimal-like objects.
- Fixed workflow candidate persistence in `packages/workflow/src/repository.ts` so `SignalCandidate.createMany()` writes plain numbers into Float-backed columns instead of `Prisma.Decimal` wrappers.
- Realigned `SignalCandidate.reasonsJson` and `warningsJson` in `prisma/schema.prisma` to `Json?`, matching the existing workflow and signals code that persists structured arrays.
- Verified the evening workflow end to end with the current mock data path; the workflow now persists run history, step history, signal candidates, snapshots, and the Tonight's Workflow card payload expected by the Phase 4 verifier.

## Verification

- `npx prisma generate` → client regenerated after schema alignment
- `npm run db:verify` → local SQLite schema confirmed in sync
- `npm run verify:phase4` → passed

## Notes

- The verified workflow run completed with overall status `PARTIAL`, which is expected for the current fixture state because risk review and broker sync surface actionable issues without aborting the orchestration.
- The latest clean verifier run recorded 30 scanned symbols, 30 persisted candidates, 3 draft next-session trades on the card, and a successful `verify-stops` step after missing-stop backfill.

---

# Phase 3 Broker Sync — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — broker-sync persistence and portfolio view only; no stop ladder, position sizing, or risk-gate logic changes
**Goal:** Complete and verify Phase 3 only by restoring the broker-sync schema contract, wiring the current scripts, and validating manual broker sync plus discrepancy audit logging.

## Plan

- [x] Recheck the Phase 3 contract against the current broker and portfolio packages
- [x] Restore the Phase 3 Prisma schema fields/enums needed by the existing broker-sync code path
- [x] Wire the missing Phase 3 package scripts in `package.json`
- [x] Regenerate Prisma client and sync the local SQLite schema
- [x] Run `verify:phase3` and record the result

## Review

- Confirmed the broker adapter boundary, sync job, mock broker fixture, and portfolio view already existed in `packages/broker` and `packages/portfolio`.
- Restored the Phase 3 schema contract needed by that code path, including broker-sync run persistence, broker account/order fields, richer portfolio snapshot fields, and stop enum values used by sync/reconciliation.
- Aliased the stop enums in the workflow and Phase 3 verifier to match the current schema naming.
- Added package scripts for `broker:sync`, `broker:scheduler`, `portfolio:view`, and `verify:phase3`.
- Verified manual sync end to end with the mock broker fixture.

## Verification

- `npx prisma generate` → client regenerated after schema alignment
- `npm run db:verify` → local SQLite schema confirmed in sync
- `npm run verify:phase3` → passed

## Notes

- Phase 3 verification produced the expected discrepancy audit trail: new broker positions missing locally, one local position absent from broker, one orphan stop, and one filled order without a plan.

---

# User Drift Fix + Phase 2 Market Data — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — schema repair and data-ingestion layer only; no stop/risk/position-sizing logic changes
**Goal:** Repair the local User-table drift so shared seed runs cleanly again, then complete and verify the Phase 2 market-data ingestion workflow only.

## Plan

- [x] Make schema drift repair work without requiring `better-sqlite3`
- [x] Repair the local SQLite drift and re-run shared seed cleanly
- [x] Wire the missing Phase 2 package scripts in `package.json`
- [x] Verify the existing Phase 2 market-data ingestion flow against the current workspace
- [x] Record results and any remaining blockers

## Review

- Updated `scripts/db-verify.mjs` to fall back to Prisma raw SQL when `better-sqlite3` is unavailable, so local schema drift can still self-heal.
- Ran `npm run db:verify`, which repaired the missing `User.onboardingDismissed` column and the remaining scaffold-compatibility columns in the local SQLite file.
- Re-ran `npm run db:seed` successfully; the default user bootstrap now completes cleanly again.
- Restored the Phase 2 Prisma schema contract needed by `packages/data`, including `DataRefreshRun`, `DataRefreshResult`, the stale-data fields on `Instrument`, and the JSON-backed job/audit fields used by the ingestion pipeline.
- Added package scripts for `db:verify`, `refresh:daily-bars`, `market-data:scheduler`, and `verify:phase2`.
- Verified Phase 2 end to end: 30 symbols refreshed successfully, reruns stayed idempotent, and an invalid symbol was marked stale.

## Verification

- `npm run db:verify` → repaired local drift, then reported all columns present
- `npm run db:seed` → completed cleanly with default user bootstrap succeeding
- `npx prisma generate` → regenerated client with Phase 2 models
- `npm run verify:phase2` → passed

## Notes

- Prisma still emits the existing `package.json#prisma` deprecation warning, but the repo already uses `prisma.config.ts`; no Phase 2 change was required there.

---

# Phase 1 Persistence Compatibility — 8 Mar 2026

**Risk-sensitive:** NO — additive persistence layer only, no sacred trading logic changes
**Goal:** Restore the Phase 1 build-order schema contract in the current HybridTurtle workspace without disturbing existing app models.

## Plan

- [x] Add the missing Phase 1 Prisma enums and models to `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] Extend `prisma/seed.ts` to seed sample `Instrument` rows for Phase 1
- [x] Wire `verify:phase1` in `package.json` and harden `scripts/verify-phase1.ts`
- [x] Create and apply a Prisma migration for the additive Phase 1 models
- [x] Run seed + Phase 1 verification and record results here

## Review

- Added the build-order Phase 1 compatibility models back into `prisma/schema.prisma` so `Instrument`, `PlannedTrade`, `DailyBar`, `SignalRun`, `SignalCandidate`, and the other required Phase 1 tables exist again.
- Reused the existing local migration history after Prisma confirmed the database was already up to date with the restored migration chain.
- Extended `prisma/seed.ts` to upsert sample Phase 1 instruments without disturbing the existing `Stock` universe seed.
- Added `verify:phase1` to `package.json` and made `scripts/verify-phase1.ts` repeatable.
- Verified acceptance criteria with `npm run verify:phase1`.

## Verification

- `npx prisma migrate status` → database schema is up to date
- `npx prisma generate` → client regenerated with Phase 1 models
- `npm run db:seed` → completed; Phase 1 instruments seeded
- `npm run verify:phase1` → passed

## Notes

- The earlier local `User.onboardingDismissed` drift has been repaired via `npm run db:verify`; shared seed now completes cleanly.

# Breakout Probability Score (BPS) — Implementation Plan

**Date:** 28 Feb 2026
**Risk-sensitive:** NO — read-only scoring module, no position sizing/stop/gate changes
**Sacred files touched:** NONE

---

## What BPS Is

A supplementary 0–19 score that estimates the probability of a successful breakout based on 7 factors. Sits **alongside** the existing NCS/BQS/FWS system — does NOT replace it. Higher BPS = more structural evidence for a clean breakout.

---

## 7 Factors (max 19 points total)

| # | Factor | Max Pts | Data Source | Logic |
|---|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Consolidation Quality | 3 | ATR% + close vs MA200 | Tighter = better. ATR% < 2% = 3, < 3% = 2, < 4% = 1 |
| 2 | Volume Accumulation Slope | 3 | Last 20 volume bars (linear regression slope) | Positive slope = accumulation. Steep positive = 3 |
| 3 | RS Rank | 3 | rs_vs_benchmark_pct (already computed) | > 10% = 3, > 5% = 2, > 0% = 1 |

## Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/breakout-probability.ts` | Core algorithm: `calcBPS()`, `linearRegressionSlope()`, `BPSResult` type |
| `src/lib/breakout-probability.test.ts` | Vitest tests for calcBPS + linear regression |
| `src/lib/sector-etf-cache.ts` | In-memory sector ETF momentum cache + nightly refresh function |

## Files to Modify

| File | Change | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| `src/app/api/scan/cross-ref/route.ts` | Add `bps` field to CrossRefTicker response | None — additive field |
| `src/app/scan/cross-ref/page.tsx` | Show BPS column in cross-ref table | None — display only |
| `src/lib/ready-to-buy.ts` | Add `bps` to CrossRefTicker type, use BPS as tiebreaker in sort | None — display sort only |
| `src/components/portfolio/ReadyToBuyPanel.tsx` | Show BPS badge on candidate cards | None — display only |
| `src/app/api/backtest/route.ts` | Compute and return BPS for each signal hit | None — read-only |
| `src/app/backtest/page.tsx` | Add BPS column to signal table | None — display only |
| `src/cron/nightly.ts` | Add sector ETF cache refresh in Step 5 (non-blocking) | Low — isolated try/catch |

## Implementation Steps

- [x] 1. Explore codebase and understand data flow
- [x] 2. Write this plan
- [x] 3. Create `src/lib/breakout-probability.ts` with pure calcBPS function

- [x] 6. Wire BPS into cross-ref API route
- [x] 7. Show BPS on scan cross-ref page
- [x] 8. Add BPS to ready-to-buy sort + display on portfolio panel
- [x] 9. Add BPS to backtest API + show on signal replay page

# HybridTurtle Optimization Audit — 22 Feb 2026

## Audit Summary

The app is **functionally solid** with good error handling, proper Prisma patterns, and well-structured Zustand state. But there are clear optimization wins — particularly around bundle size and code splitting.

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Prisma singleton + indexes | ✅ Good | Proper globalThis pattern, good index coverage |
| Error handling in API routes | ✅ Good | Consistent `apiError()` helper everywhere |
| Tailwind config / CSS | ✅ Good | Proper purge paths, dark mode config |
| Tree-shaking imports | ✅ Good | All lucide-react/recharts use named imports |
| TypeScript strict mode | ✅ Good | Enabled in tsconfig |
| Zustand store | ✅ Good | Single lightweight store with 10-min cache |
| No polling (intentional) | ✅ Good | Dashboard checked 1-2x daily, no wasted API calls |
| Code splitting / dynamic imports | ❌ None | recharts (~200KB) + lightweight-charts (~45KB) statically imported |
| Server components | ❌ Underused | Every page/component is `'use client'` — zero SSR |
| HTTP cache headers | ❌ Missing | No API routes return Cache-Control headers |
| React.memo | ❌ Missing | No pure components wrapped in React.memo |
| Index-based keys | ⚠️ Minor | 22 instances of `key={i}` in `.map()` calls |

---

## HIGH Priority — Worth Fixing

### 1. Dynamic Import Heavy Chart Libraries

**Impact:** ~245KB removed from main bundle for non-chart pages.

5 components statically import recharts/lightweight-charts. Every page loads these even when no charts are visible.

**Files to change:**
- `src/components/portfolio/PerformanceChart.tsx` — recharts
- `src/components/portfolio/DistributionDonut.tsx` — recharts
- `src/components/scan/scores/NCSDistributionChart.tsx` — recharts
- `src/components/scan/scores/BQSvsFWSScatter.tsx` — recharts
- `src/components/scan/TickerChart.tsx` — lightweight-charts

**Fix:** Wrap each with `next/dynamic`:
```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const PerformanceChart = dynamic(() => import('@/components/portfolio/PerformanceChart'), { ssr: false });
```

### 2. Remove Unnecessary `'use client'` from Pure Components

**Impact:** Smaller client bundle, enables server rendering for static UI.

11+ components are `'use client'` but use no hooks, events, or browser APIs:
- `StatusBadge.tsx` — pure render
- `TrafficLight.tsx` — pure render
- `RegimeBadge.tsx` — pure render
- `DualScoreKPICards.tsx` — pure render
- `WhyCard.tsx` — pure render
- `StageFunnel.tsx` — pure render
- `KPIBanner.tsx` — pure render
- `SleeveAllocation.tsx` — pure render
- `ProtectionProgress.tsx` — pure render
- `TechnicalFilterGrid.tsx` — pure render
- `QuickActions.tsx` — only uses `Link`

**Note:** Since parent pages are also `'use client'`, removing these directives alone won't enable SSR. The full benefit comes when parent pages are also converted. But it's still good hygiene.

---

## MEDIUM Priority — Nice to Have

### 3. Add HTTP Cache Headers for Stable Data

API routes that return infrequently-changing data should set cache headers:

```ts
// In route handler:
return NextResponse.json(data, {
  headers: { 'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=60' }
});
```

**Candidates:**
- `/api/stocks` — ticker list rarely changes
- `/api/trade-log` — historical data, append-only
- `/api/settings` — user settings change rarely

### 4. Add Missing DB Indexes

```prisma
model Heartbeat {
  @@index([timestamp])  // queried for "latest heartbeat"
}

model SnapshotTicker {
  @@index([snapshotId, ticker])  // composite for common query pattern
}
```

### 5. Prisma `select` Over `include` in API Routes

Several routes use `include: { stock: true }` which fetches all Stock columns when only `ticker` and `currency` are needed. Using `select` reduces data transferred.

**Example fix in positions/route.ts:**
```ts
// Before
include: { stock: true }
// After  
include: { stock: { select: { ticker: true, currency: true, name: true } } }
```

## LOW Priority — Marginal Gains

### 6. Fix Index-Based Keys (22 instances)

Replace `key={i}` with stable identifiers where lists can reorder. Most concerning:
- `PositionsTable.tsx` — position data divs
- `ActionCardWidget.tsx` — 9 separate `key={i}` usages
- `PreTradeChecklist.tsx` — checklist items
- `settings/page.tsx` — stock items

### 7. Wrap Pure Components in React.memo

Components like `StatusBadge`, `RegimeBadge`, `KPIBanner` receive same props frequently. Wrapping in `React.memo` prevents wasted re-renders. Low impact since re-render frequency is low (dashboard checked 1-2x daily).

### 8. Clean Up Unused next.config.js

`images.domains: ['avatars.githubusercontent.com']` is configured but no `<img>` or `next/image` is used anywhere. Can be removed for clarity.

---

## NOT Worth Changing

| Item | Why Skip |
|------|----------|
| Add SWR/React Query | Zustand store with 10-min cache is sufficient for 1-2x daily usage |
| Convert all pages to Server Components | Major refactor; single-user dashboard doesn't benefit from SSR |
| Add streaming to /api/scan | Complexity not justified for weekly scan usage |
| Zod in client bundle | Only ~13KB, validation is important |
| Polling/real-time data | Intentionally disabled — dashboard is not a live trading terminal |

---

## Recommended Action Plan

If you want to apply fixes, I'd suggest this order:
1. **Dynamic imports for charts** (biggest bang for buck — ~245KB savings)
2. **Remove unused `images` config** (trivial cleanup)
3. **Add DB indexes** (trivial, prevents future perf issues)
4. **Cache headers on stable API routes** (easy win)
5. **Prisma select optimization** (gradual, route by route)

Want me to implement any of these?

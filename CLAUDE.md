## What This System Is

A systematic trading dashboard for momentum trend-following across ~268 tickers (US, UK, European markets). Built to turn discretionary stock trading into a repeatable, risk-first workflow.

- **Stack:** Next.js 14 App Router + React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Prisma ORM + SQLite
- **Data:** Yahoo Finance (free, no API key — this is intentional, do not suggest replacing it)
- **Notifications:** Telegram Bot API
- **Broker:** Trading 212 (dual-account: Invest + ISA)
- **Account type:** Small account (SMALL_ACCOUNT risk profile), starting ~£429 + £50/week additions
- **Testing:** Vitest (39 test files) + Zod validation
- **Pages:** 26 content pages + 5 redirects
- **API Routes:** 44 route groups (~105 endpoints)
- **DB Tables:** 40 (24 core + 16 prediction engine)
- **Architecture:** Two-layer: Core Trading Engine (sacred) + Prediction Engine (post-processing)

## Weekly Operating Rhythm (Do Not Break This Logic)

| Day | Phase | Rules |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Sunday | PLANNING | Full scan, draft trade plan |
| Monday | OBSERVATION | No trading. Anti-chase guard active |
| Tuesday | EXECUTION | Pre-trade checklist, execute planned trades |
| Wed–Fri | MAINTENANCE | Stop updates, risk monitoring |

The Monday trading block and Tuesday execution window are **behavioural guardrails**, not bugs. Do not remove or soften them.

## Architecture — Files That Must Not Be Casually Changed

### 🔴 Sacred Files (changes affect real money — flag before touching)

| File | What It Does | Critical Rule |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `stop-manager.ts` | Monotonic stop protection | **Stops NEVER decrease. Ever. This is the most important rule in the system.** |
| `position-sizer.ts` | Share calculation | Use `floorShares()` (never `Math.round()` or `Math.ceil()`). Integer brokers floor to whole shares; T212 uses `allowFractional: true` to floor to 0.01 shares. FX conversion applied before sizing. |
| `risk-gates.ts` | 6 hard gates | All 6 must pass. Never short-circuit, bypass, or add a soft override. |
| `regime-detector.ts` | Market environment | Requires 3 consecutive days same regime for BULLISH confirmation. Do not reduce this. |
| `dual-score.ts` | BQS / FWS / NCS scoring | Weights are intentional. Do not rebalance without explicit instruction. |

### 🟡 Important Files (changes have downstream effects — think before editing)

| File | Consumed By |
|------|------------|
| `scan-engine.ts` | `/api/scan/route.ts`, nightly.ts |
| `regime-detector.ts` | risk-gates.ts, scan-engine.ts, nightly.ts |
| `dual-score.ts` | `/api/scan/route.ts`, cross-reference logic |
| `nightly.ts` | Task Scheduler automation — changes affect unattended runs |
| `signal-weight-meta-model.ts` | Signal weights API, NCS display layer — handle with care |
| `conformal-calibrator.ts` | Interval API, NCSIntervalBadge — handle with care |

---

## Two-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1 — Core Trading Engine (sacred, never modify):**
```
scan-engine → dual-score → risk-gates → position-sizer → stop-manager
regime-detector feeds all layers
```
All capital allocation, position sizing, and stop management lives here. Never modified by prediction work.

**Layer 2 — Prediction Engine (post-processing, advisory only):**
```
Conformal intervals → Failure modes → Dynamic weights → Stress test
→ Signal audit → Immune system → Lead-lag/GNN → Bayesian beliefs
→ Kelly multiplier → Meta-RL advisor → VPIN → Sentiment → TDA
→ Execution quality → Causal invariance → TradePulse synthesis
```
Sits entirely above Layer 1. Wraps NCS output — never replaces it. All suppression of Auto-Yes is **advisory display only** — never touches execution logic in sacred files.

### Key Design Decisions
- Auto-Yes suppression is **advisory display only** — never touches execution
- RL advisor is **shadow mode by default** — never fires orders autonomously
- Kelly multiplier is **opt-in** — default OFF in settings
- Conformal intervals are **post-processing** — dual-score.ts unchanged
- Invariance penalty applied **after** dynamic weighting, **before** display
- Monday hard block on new entries — enforced in code, not just UI
- Wednesday–Friday opportunistic entries require higher bar than Tuesday

## The Scan Engine — 7-Stage Pipeline

Do not add, remove, or reorder stages without being asked explicitly.

1. **Universe** — Load active tickers from DB
2. **Technical Filters** — Hard: price > MA200, ADX ≥ 20, +DI > −DI, ATR% cap, data quality. Soft: efficiency < 30 → WATCH
3. **Status Classification** — ≤2% to trigger = READY, ≤3% = WATCH, >3% = FAR
4. **Ranking** — Composite: sleeve priority + status bonus + ADX + volume ratio + efficiency + relative strength
5. **Risk Gates** — All 6 must pass (see risk-gates.ts)
6. **Anti-Chase Guard** — Configurable gap thresholds (ATR + %). Blocks if price extended too far above trigger. Optional slippage buffer tightens thresholds based on historical trade slippage. Monday uses weekend thresholds; Tue–Fri uses daily thresholds
7. **Position Sizing** — `floor(Equity × Risk% / (Entry − Stop) × FX)`

---

## Dual Score System

**BQS (Breakout Quality Score, 0–100)** — Higher is better
- Trend strength, direction dominance, volatility health, proximity to breakout, market tailwind, relative strength, volume

**FWS (Fatal Weakness Score, 0–95 achievable, clamped to 100)** — Higher is WORSE
- Volume risk (max 30) + extension/chasing risk (max 25) + marginal trend (max 10) + vol shock (max 20) + regime instability (max 10) = 95 max achievable in practice

**NCS (Net Composite Score)** = BQS − (0.8 × FWS) + 10, minus earnings/cluster penalties

**Auto-actions:**
- NCS ≥ 70 AND FWS ≤ 30 → Auto-Yes
- FWS > 65 → Auto-No
- Otherwise → Conditional

---

## Risk Profiles

| Profile | Risk/Trade | Max Positions | Max Open Risk |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| CONSERVATIVE | 0.75% | 8 | 7.0% |
| BALANCED | 0.95% | 5 | 5.5% |
| **SMALL_ACCOUNT** | **2.00%** | **4** | **10.0%** | ← ACTIVE |
| AGGRESSIVE | 3.00% | 3 | 12.0% |

**Active profile is SMALL_ACCOUNT.** Max 4 positions. This is not a bug.

---

## Stop Manager — Monotonic Ladder

| Level | Triggers At | Stop Moves To |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| INITIAL | Entry | Entry − InitialRisk |
| BREAKEVEN | ≥ 1.5R | Entry price |
| LOCK_08R | ≥ 2.5R | Entry + 0.5 × InitialRisk |
| LOCK_1R_TRAIL | ≥ 3.0R | max(Entry + 1R, Close − 2×ATR) |

**Stops ratchet up only. A function that could lower a stop is a bug, not a feature.**

---

## The 6 Risk Gates (all must pass)

1. **Total Open Risk** — Current + new risk ≤ profile max
2. **Max Positions** — Open count < profile limit
3. **Sleeve Limit** — Sleeve value ≤ cap (CORE 80%, HIGH_RISK 40%)
4. **Cluster Concentration** — ≤ 20% of portfolio (SMALL_ACCOUNT: 25%)
5. **Sector Concentration** — ≤ 25% of portfolio (SMALL_ACCOUNT: 30%)
6. **Position Size Cap** — Per-position value ≤ profile-aware % of portfolio

HEDGE positions excluded from open risk and position counting.

## Prediction Engine — Quick Reference

All prediction phases are **post-processing layers** — they never modify sacred files. They read NCS/BQS/FWS outputs and add advisory scoring, confidence intervals, and risk assessment.

| # | Component | Key File(s) | Reads | Writes | Touches Risk? |
|---|-----------|------------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Conformal Intervals | `conformal-calibrator.ts`, `conformal-store.ts`, `bootstrap-calibration.ts` | ScoreBreakdown, ScanResult | ConformalCalibration | No — wraps NCS in confidence bands |
| 2 | Failure Mode Scoring | `failure-mode-scorer.ts`, `failure-mode-thresholds.ts` | ScanResult, RegimeHistory | FailureModeScore | No — advisory, blocks Auto-Yes if FM > threshold |
| 3 | Dynamic Signal Weighting | `signal-weight-meta-model.ts`, `meta-model-trainer.ts` | VIX, RegimeHistory, InvarianceAuditResult | SignalWeightRecord | No — display-layer reweighting only |
| 4 | Adversarial Stress Test | `adversarial-simulator.ts` | Market data, ATR | StressTestResult | No — Monte Carlo stop-hit probability |
| 5 | Signal Pruning (MI) | `mutual-information.ts` | ScoreBreakdown | SignalAuditResult | No — analysis page only |
| 6 | Immune System | `threat-library.ts`, `danger-matcher.ts`, `environment-encoder.ts` | VIX, SPY, breadth | ThreatLibraryEntry | No — tightens risk via display layer |
| 7 | Lead-Lag Graph | `lead-lag-analyser.ts`, `lead-lag-graph.ts` | Daily prices | LeadLagEdge, LeadLagSignal | No — NCS adjustment display layer |
| F1 | GNN (GraphSAGE) | `gnn/*.ts` (4 files) | LeadLagEdge | GNNModelWeights, GNNInferenceLog | No — graph propagation scoring |
| F2 | Bayesian NCS | `bayesian/*.ts` (3 files) | TradeLog outcomes | SignalBeliefState | No — belief-informed weight adjustments |
| F3 | Kelly Sizing | `kelly/*.ts` (3 files) | NCS, conformal width, GNN conf | — (advisory only) | No — advisory sizing suggestion |
| F4 | Meta-RL Advisor | `meta-rl/*.ts` (4 files) | R-multiple, days held, ATR | TradeEpisode, PolicyVersion | No — advisory recommendations only |
| F5 | VPIN / Order Flow | `signals/vpin-calculator.ts`, `order-flow-imbalance.ts` | Yahoo volume bars | VPINHistory | No — order flow indicator |
| F6 | Sentiment Fusion | `signals/sentiment/*.ts` (4 files) | News RSS, Yahoo data | SentimentHistory | No — sentiment composite score |
| F7 | TDA Regime | `TDARegimeBadge.tsx` (component only) | — (prop-based) | — | No — topology-based regime badge |
| F8 | Execution Quality | `execution-audit.ts`, `execution-drag.ts`, `slippage-tracker.ts` | TradeLog fills | — | No — slippage analysis |
| F9 | TradePulse | `trade-pulse.ts` | All signal APIs | — | No — unified score aggregation |
| 14 | Causal Invariance | `causal/*.ts` (4 files) | ScoreBreakdown | InvarianceAuditResult | No — IRM analysis, feeds back into Phase 3 weights |

> All files live under `lib/prediction/` or `lib/signals/`. None modify sacred files.

## Known Gotchas — Read Before Writing Any Data or Calculation Code

### Yahoo Finance
- Returns **adjusted closes** — dividend-adjusted, not split-only
- UK tickers require `.L` suffix (e.g., `BATS.L`)
- European tickers require exchange suffix (e.g., `.AS`, `.PA`, `.DE`)
- Occasionally returns stale or null data — Module 18 validates but always add null guards
- No SLA — if Yahoo is down, the nightly task must fail gracefully, not crash
- All Yahoo calls are wrapped in `withRetry()` (3 attempts, exponential backoff: 1s→2s→4s). Only retries on transient errors (429, 5xx, network). See `src/lib/fetch-retry.ts`
- Staleness tracked via `getDataFreshness()` — returns `LIVE`, `CACHE`, or `STALE_CACHE` with age in minutes
- On Tuesdays (EXECUTION phase), key fetch functions accept `forceRefresh: true` to bypass cache
- If a live fetch fails, stale cached data is served (with `STALE_CACHE` tracking) rather than returning null

### Technical Indicators
- ADX calculation requires **minimum 28 candles** of history — always check data length before calculating
- MA200 requires 200 candles — short-history tickers must be excluded, not defaulted
- ATR spike logic can either soft-cap or hard-block depending on context — check which before modifying

### Database (SQLite + Prisma)
- SQLite has **no native date functions** — use JavaScript Date manipulation, not SQL date queries
- Multi-table writes must use **Prisma transactions** — never write to positions and equity_snapshots independently
- Equity snapshots are **rate-limited to once per 6 hours** — do not remove this guard
- `dev.db` is local only — no cloud sync, no concurrent access assumptions

### Database Schema Changes (MANDATORY)
- **NEVER** use `prisma db push` for schema changes
- **ALWAYS** use: `npx prisma migrate dev --name description`
- After any schema change:
  - Commit the migration file with the code change
  - The migration file IS the schema change record
  - Other machines run: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- `prisma migrate deploy` is safe — it never resets, never prompts, just applies pending migrations
- On a fresh machine with no `dev.db`: `npx prisma migrate deploy` creates the DB and applies all migrations
- The `start.bat` and `nightly-task.bat` scripts auto-run `prisma migrate deploy` before starting
- The dashboard shows a warning banner if pending migrations are detected (`/api/db-status`)

### Position Sizing
- Always use `floorShares()` on share count — never `Math.round()` or `Math.ceil()`, never raw `Math.floor()`
- FX conversion (GBP↔USD↔EUR) must be applied **before** the sizing formula, not after
- Risk% is per-profile — never hardcode a percentage

### Regime Detector
- ±2% CHOP band around SPY MA200 forces SIDEWAYS regardless of other signals
- Dual benchmark (Module 19) checks both SPY and VWRL — **both** must be bullish for BULLISH confirmation
- 3-day stability requirement is non-negotiable

## Nightly Automation — 9-Step Sequence (+ prediction sub-steps)

Runs via `nightly-task.bat` / Task Scheduler. Runs unattended. Failures must be caught and written to DB heartbeat, not allowed to throw unhandled.

1. Health Check (16-point audit)
2. Live Prices (open positions only) + data freshness check
3. Stop Management (R-based recs + auto-apply trailing ATR only)
4. Laggard Detection
5. Risk Modules
6. Equity Snapshot (rate-limited: once per 6 hours) + Equity Milestone Advisory (£1K/£2K/£5K thresholds)
7. Snapshot Sync (full universe refresh + top 15 READY candidates)
   - 7b. Conformal calibration recalibration (non-critical)
   - 7c. Signal weight meta-model training (Sunday only)
   - 7d. Lead-lag graph recomputation (Sunday only)
   - 7e. GNN training (Sunday only, after lead-lag)
8. Telegram Alert
9. Heartbeat (write SUCCESS/PARTIAL/FAILED to DB with step-level results)

**Step-level tracking:** Each step is timed via `startStep()`/`finalizeSteps()`. Failed steps are recorded individually.

**Heartbeat status is ternary:**
- **SUCCESS** — all steps completed without error
- **PARTIAL** — some steps failed but pipeline completed (amber on dashboard)
- **FAILED** — critical failure

**If any step fails: log the error, continue remaining steps where possible. Never let one failed step abort the whole nightly run.**

**Watchdog:** A separate `watchdog.ts` script (`watchdog-task.bat`) runs daily at 10:00 AM. If no nightly heartbeat exists within 26 hours, it sends a Telegram alert.

## Coding Standards for This Project

```typescript
// ✅ DO
floorShares(equity * riskPct / rPerShare, allowFractional) // position sizing
// allowFractional: true for Trading 212 (floors to 0.01 shares)
// allowFractional: false (default) for integer-share brokers (floors to whole shares)
await prisma.$transaction([...])            // multi-table writes
if (!data || data.length < 28) return null  // null guards before indicators
ticker.endsWith('.L')                       // UK ticker detection

// ❌ DON'T
Math.round(shares)           // rounding up position sizes
Math.floor(shares)           // use floorShares() instead
any                          // TypeScript any type
// lowering a stop value     // ever, under any circumstance
prisma.positions.update()    // without checking stop monotonicity first
```

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any` types
- **Zod** for all external data validation (Yahoo Finance responses especially)
- **Vitest** for tests — add tests for any new calculation logic
- Prefer **surgical edits** over full rewrites
- Add a brief comment on non-obvious trading logic decisions

### Testing Coverage (39 test files)
Before any sacred file change (which should essentially never happen), the full Vitest suite must pass.
Coverage areas: position-sizer, risk-gates, stop-manager, dual-score, regime-detector, scan-guards, scan-pass-flags, correlation-scalar, breakout-probability, breakout-integrity, breakout-failure, hurst, EV-modifier, laggard-detector, ready-to-buy, risk-fields, execution-audit, execution-drag, filter-attribution, filter-scorecard, score-tracker, score-validation, allocation-score, candidate-outcome, candidate-outcome-enrichment, adaptive-atr-buffer, T212-dual, market-data, fetch-retry, scan-engine-core-lite, scan-db-reconstruction, audit-harness, research-loop, plus 3 API route tests.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- Write a detailed spec upfront to `tasks/todo.md` before touching any code
- If something goes sideways mid-task, STOP and re-plan — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, use subagents rather than cramming everything into one context
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules that prevent the same mistake recurring
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at the start of each session for relevant patterns
- Ruthlessly iterate on lessons until mistake rate drops

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behaviour between main and your changes when relevant
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this PR?"

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Fix failing tests without being told how

---

## Task Management

1. **Plan First** — Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items before any implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Check in before starting implementation on anything risk-sensitive
3. **Track Progress** — Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes** — High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results** — Add review section to `tasks/todo.md` when done
6. **Capture Lessons** — Update `tasks/lessons.md` after any correction

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First** — Make every change as simple as possible. Minimal code impact.
- **No Laziness** — Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact** — Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

---

## How to Work With Me on This Project

1. **One task per session** — don't compound tasks
2. **Ask before refactoring** anything outside the stated task scope
3. **Flag explicitly** if a change could affect position sizing, stop logic, or risk gates
4. **List all changed files** at the end of every task
5. **Note any side effects** I should test manually before next nightly run
6. If trading logic is ambiguous — **ask, don't assume**
7. I understand the trading logic deeply. I am not a professional TypeScript developer. **Explain non-obvious code decisions in brief inline comments.**
